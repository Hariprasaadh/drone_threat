# 🛡️ Drone Threat Detection & Classification

![Project Banner](images/landing-page.jpg)

## 🚀 Overview

The AI Drone Threat Classifier is a real-time drone detection, tracking, and classification system designed for enhanced security and surveillance. It leverages advanced AI techniques to predict drone trajectories and classify threats based on multiple parameters. The system integrates RF frequency sensing for classification, ESP32 for detecting nearby WiFi connections and their status, and blockchain technology for securely storing data on malicious drones, including their speed, coordinates, and trajectory. The solution also features real-time map integration, allowing precise geolocation of drones on an interactive map.
